# Learning to use a database system...
often when we try to learn a new thing we dont know where to start, so this blog is going to help you get started.
I'm going to focus here more in the theoretical part because when choosing a database system we have so many options:
- postgres
- mysql
- oracle
- microsoft
- more
_when getting started with these technologies often it is better to go to their documentation._
so we are focusing on:

### [relational modeling](https://jeremycardona.github.io/thedatabase/modeling)
1. attributes
2. schemas
3. attributes
4. keys

### [relational querying](https://jeremycardona.github.io/thedatabase/querying)
1. operations
2. projection
3. selection

### [relational design](https://jeremycardona.github.io/thedatabase/design)
1. functional dependencies
2. design of schemas
3. normal forms
